```{r}
library(GGally)
library(skimr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Basic Data Exploration

-   names: get variable names

-   dim: get data dimensions

-   head: get first n lines (6 by default)

-   tail: get last n lines (6 by default)

-   summary: get basic summary statistics

```{r}
names(penguins)

dim(penguins)

head(penguins)

tail(penguins)
# na in summary means how many missing values
summary(penguins)
```

```{r}
#way to explicitly state which package you want to pull a function from
skimr::skim(penguins)

```

```{r}
# created a grid showing different data comparisons between variables
ggpairs(penguins)
```
